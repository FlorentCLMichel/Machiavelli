# Machiavelli

*Work in progressâ€”this project is still in very early development*

This is a simple implementation of a Machiavelli-like card game in the terminal.

## The game

Machiavelli is an Italian card game derived from Rummy. The rules can be found [here](https://gamerules.com/rules/machiavelli-card-game/).

At the moment, only a one-player version of the game is implemented (because ~~that's the only way I can win at this game~~ the current design is not well-suited for multiplayer). 

## Build

To build this game, you need a Rust compiler (probably at least version 1.41.0; I tested it with rustc version 1.51.0). If you have cargo installed, you may build it by running `cargo build --release`. The executable will be placed in the folder `target/release`.
