# Machiavelli

*Work in progressâ€”this project is still in very early development*

This is a simple implementation of the Machiavelli card game in the terminal.

## Build

To build this game, you need a Rust compiler (probably at least version 1.41.0; I tested it with rustc version 1.51.0). If you have cargo installed, you may build it by running `cargo build --release`. The executable will be placed in the folder `target/release`.
